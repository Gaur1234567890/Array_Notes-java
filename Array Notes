What is Array ?
Ans -
1. Array is a collection of simillar type of data element.
2. Array is a linear Data structure.
3. Array starts with index 0 and end with size-1.
4. Arrayy are used to arrange data in sequentially.
5. Array can store fix sized of elements.
6. in java , Array is a object.

How to implement java program ?
Ans -
1. Array Declaration - (create array Object)

int []arr;

2. Array Creation :- give to size of the array element

int [] arr = new int[5];

3. Array initialization :-

int arr[0]=10;
int arr[1]=20;
int arr[2]=30;
int arr[3]=40;
int arr[4]=50;

4. Array Traversing :-

visit / perform operation


** if you give the element but loop will be execute more than time than generate exception -

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException


AD && AC && AI into one line -

int []arr= {10,20,30,40,50};

** if you want to print the object of array than complier return 

className@<hashvalue>

ArrayType              className    
int[]          -          [I
double[]       -          [D
byte[]         -          [B 
short[]        -          [S
long[]         -          [L 
float[]        -          [F
char[]         -          [C 
boolan[]       -          [Z
String[]       -          [L java.lang


                                                  Arrays Class 

1. Arrays class belong to java.util package
2. Arrays class  consist of static method . that makes to easier call without object and call with by the class name.
3. no need to used complicated loops to work with an Array.

Methods :-

Sort() - 
binarySearch() -
toString()-
asList() -
equals() - 
fill() -
